## Installation

Create a virtual environment, activate it, and you can then install the dependencies using `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

**NOTE: ** Tensorflow 2.8.0 is also a dependency, but we haven't included it in the `requirements.txt` file; instructions to install this specific (CPU-only) version of tensorflow will be included.
